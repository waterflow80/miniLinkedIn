# miniLinkedIn
The MiniLinkedIn project aims at providing a web based user interface that allows users to instantly create a custom resume by providing their information, post job offers by providing the job description (requirements, responsibilities, salary, etc..) and also try to find a job or match that best fits the userâ€™s resume (created on the platform).
